The resulting regression model is stored in the variable model. The summary of the model, generated using the summary function, offers detailed information on coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values, providing insights into the relationships between the predictor variables and the target variable. This summary aids in interpreting the significance of each predictor in explaining the variation in miles per gallon in the context of the dataset.`***\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the mtcars dataset (if not already loaded)\ndata(mtcars)\n\n# Perform linear regression (e.g., predicting mpg based on other variables)\nmodel <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + qsec, data = mtcars)\n\n# Display the summary of the regression model\nsummary(model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ wt + hp + qsec, data = mtcars)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.8591 -1.6418 -0.4636  1.1940  5.6092 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The model suggests that weight has a substantial negative impact on mpg, while there is no statistically significant effect from horsepower and quarter-mile time. The overall model is highly significant (p-value: 4.506e-11) with a strong explanatory power (Adjusted R-squared: 0.8171), indicating that the chosen variables collectively account for a significant portion of the variance in miles per gallon in the mtcars dataset.`***\n",
